This is an example of using Express and NodeJS to render HTML content from
the WordPress REST API

## TODO
1. Fetch calls can be combined just need to work through the separate endpoints
2. Styles for cleaner render
3. WebPack and Babel to convert to ES6
4. Clean up async and await for a single Promise
5. Add React and render isomorphic
6. Remove Pug templates
7. Use React Router
